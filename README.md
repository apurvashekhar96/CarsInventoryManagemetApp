Car Shop: Developed a React application that allows users to manage car inventory by adding cars and their cost. The application displays the cars in a list with a dynamically generated total cost. Utilized the useState, UseContext and useEffect hooks for managing the state of the application and updating the UI accordingly. Implemented a feature for adding new cars to the inventory and displaying them in a list format, along with their cost. Implemented a search bar that allows users to filter the list of cars by their name, make and model. Utilized Git for version control. The application is optimized for performance and accessibility. Deployed the website on netlify for easy access to users.
